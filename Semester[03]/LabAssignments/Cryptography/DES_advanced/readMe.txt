To be given as inputs :
-----------------------
input.txt - should contain our plain text(max. limit of plain text is 64kb)
key.text - should contain 64-bit key (e.g .  0001001100110100010101110111100110011011101111001101111111110001)

Produced outputs :
------------------
result.txt - would contatin decrypted text
bits.txt - should contain plain text converted in bits
cipher.txt - should contatin encrypted text in bits
decrypted.txt - should contain decrypted text in bits

Validation:
-----------
For correct execution check : result.txt == input.txt
